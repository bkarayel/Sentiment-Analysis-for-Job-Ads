6,"                  Introduction                 The Wallich is a homelessness charity delivering innovative housing and support services to homeless and vulnerably housed people. The Organisation formed in 1978 in Cardiff and now supports around 8000 people a year across Wales. Our work falls into four principal areas:            1. Residential supported housing projects, including direct access hostels, emergency night shelters and accommodation for people with specific issues such as substance misuse, youth services etc.            2. Floating (Tenancy) support projects in which we support people who have tenancy difficulties, sometimes with a contributing health or other need, and are in danger of losing their homes.            3. Prevention or intervention projects supplied through Homelessness Prevention Grant funding which are a broad range of services that prevent homelessness or make life better for homeless people.            4. Participation and Progression services, which are embedded in all our projects enhancing support through providing opportunities for Service Users to take an active part in their community. These services include those designed to enable people to move into meaningful activities including employment and training opportunities.            The Wallich’s values are of empowerment and treating people with dignity, respect and unconditional positive regard. The Wallich is committed to providing services that are trauma informed and delivered with Psychologically Informed Environments (PIE) at the heart of its support. A PIE is an approach to supporting people out of homelessness whilst making significant and positive progress in overcoming trauma, substance misuse and mental illness. It also considers the psychological needs of staff: developing skills and knowledge, increasing motivation, job satisfaction and resilience. At the heart of what we do are the people we support, who are actively and meaningfully involved in their own support and encouraged to participate in the design, development and delivery of services.

7,"                  Introduction                 The Wallich is a homelessness charity delivering innovative housing and support services to homeless and vulnerably housed people. The Organisation formed in 1978 in Cardiff and now supports around 8000 people a year across Wales. Our work falls into four principal areas:            1. Residential supported housing projects, including direct access hostels, emergency night shelters and accommodation for people with specific issues such as substance misuse, youth services etc.            2. Floating (Tenancy) support projects in which we support people who have tenancy difficulties, sometimes with a contributing health or other need, and are in danger of losing their homes.            3. Prevention or intervention projects supplied through Homelessness Prevention Grant funding which are a broad range of services that prevent homelessness or make life better for homeless people.            4. Participation and Progression services, which are embedded in all our projects enhancing support through providing opportunities for Service Users to take an active part in their community. These services include those designed to enable people to move into meaningful activities including employment and training opportunities.            The Wallich’s values are of empowerment and treating people with dignity, respect and unconditional positive regard. The Wallich is committed to providing services that are trauma informed and delivered with Psychologically Informed Environments (PIE) at the heart of its support. A PIE is an approach to supporting people out of homelessness whilst making significant and positive progress in overcoming trauma, substance misuse and mental illness. It also considers the psychological needs of staff: developing skills and knowledge, increasing motivation, job satisfaction and resilience. At the heart of what we do are the people we support, who are actively and meaningfully involved in their own support and encouraged to participate in the design, development and delivery of services.

Most of our clients have worked with us for a number of years and more than 80% return for more every year: building long-lasting relationships with our clients is the key ingredient to our success.            Insight at C Space isn’t like insight at other agencies; it’s faster, more entrepreneurial and more integrated. And it doesn’t just focus on finding the ‘truth’ but more importantly on leveraging that truth with those who matter in our clients’ organisation: we truly care about and organise ourselves around having impact on our clients' business – by either making them or saving them money.            To help us make good on our promise to clients, we’ve developed four differentiating capabilities:                         21st Century Research:           a proprietary tool-kit that allows our clients to listen to and co-create with their customers in an ongoing, iterative way using private, moderated online communities.

We love people who are self-starters, see the glass as half-full and thrive in a fast paced, entrepreneurial environment: six directors of the EMEA business have started their career at C Space as entry level consultants. We tend to attract people who are curious about the world and who have been able to match this curiosity with the ability to problem-solve challenges for clients in marketing and insight departments.            Ultimately, there are five traits that all our people have in common:                         Ambition Collaboration Appetite to learn Resourcefulness Humour                       We are passionate about our people and proud of our culture.

The department is responsible for the accounting duties for all our subsidiaries worldwide so will involve considerable and exceptional communication with the other departments throughout the business, as well as our many customers and suppliers, maintaining the amazing relationships we have cultivated over the years.

Dealing with queries – with the volume of orders and suppliers we deal with you can imagine the multitude of queries that come along with that; you will need to quickly develop a strong relationship with our purchasing team to enable you to accurately, and effectively, communicate with our suppliers to resolve any issues as quickly as possible                  Essential role requirements:             We are looking for someone with some prior skills: having a good grasp of Excel and of course the Sales Ledger are very important.

The most vital aspect of this role though is the ability to communicate with every kind of customer, supplier and colleague. If you’re good natured, confident, resolute and persistent, with excellent attention to detail, do get in touch!

As an independent medical humanitarian organisation, we deliver care based only on need, regardless of ethnic origin, gender, religion or political affiliation.            MSF relies on donations from private individuals and organisations for the majority of its income. This private funding gives MSF the freedom to respond where needs are greatest and to speak out publicly, free from any political interference.            MSF has around 40,000 local and international staff working in over 70 countries, in some of the most challenging places in the world. Our medical humanitarian projects are supported by teams in 32 countries, including the UK, spread across Europe, North and South America, Asia, Africa and Australasia.            At MSF UK, we support MSF’s operations by building relationships with our supporters, increasing awareness of our work, raising funds, providing specialist medical expertise, catalysing change on medical humanitarian issues, and recruiting field staff.

The role is applicable to a wide range of employers across the sector in both large and small firms and in industry, practice, and public sector.                        As such the assessment plan needs to have the flexibility to cater for these different operating models, support structures and commercial requirements. The end-point assessment has 2 components which have been designed to be completed once the apprentice has finished the on-programme learner journey demonstrated in the appendix.                        Both components will need to be passed in order for the apprentice to be awarded the apprenticeship.                        Apprentices will be expected to complete:                                  A synoptic end-test covering the knowledge and skills gained throughout the on-programme stage and detailed in the standard                           A portfolio and reflective discussion which will comprise a range of evidence produced in the workplace to show that the apprentice has met the knowledge, skills and behaviours detailed in the standard                           The reflective discussion will be a structured interview to examine this evidence and the learner journey in more detail                           Apprentices can therefore expect to be assessed through a combination of testing in controlled conditions, evidence produced in the workplace and recorded interview, therefore comprehensively examining the work they have completed                                               Apprenticeship standard                             Assistant accountant                       Level 3 (A level)                                  ",NEU

East London Apartments implements and promotes the Psychologically Informed Environment (PIE) model. This is an approach to supporting people out of homelessness, in particular those who have experienced complex trauma or are diagnosed with a personality disorder. It also considers the psychological needs of staff: developing skills and knowledge, increasing motivation, job satisfaction and resilience.                                                                                                                                                            Working with individuals with complex needs, who may display challenging, chaotic behaviours, regularly test boundaries and have experienced multiple traumas as a result of abuse, neglect and years of street homelessness, it is integral that the post holder is motivated to support individuals to progress. They should continually hold aspirations for individuals despite multiple setbacks, and display emotional resilience, able to process challenging incidents and remain motivated to deliver excellent support.                                                                                                                                                            Specialist Support Workers within Look Ahead are required to have either an extra dimension of experience or a higher qualification level as determined relevant for the particular post.                                                                                                                                                            You will provide information, social inclusion and vocational opportunities to support people to recover and stay well; exercise choice and control in their care and lives; and participate on an equal footing in the community. Provision of care and support is also provided to develop a model of re-enablement towards self-advocacy, self-management and empowerment, incorporating the principles and practice of recovery, co-production and peer support. Post holders will deliver trauma informed and asset based support to a caseload of up to 6 service users with needs aligned to their specialism – caseload is subject to change depending on the service needs.                                                                                                                                  The successful applicant will have experience working closely with a range of services to support individuals to recover from their dependence on drugs and or alcohol. You will have good knowledge of harm reduction techniques and various treatment approaches for addiction and be confident in the use of these approaches.

1248,"                  Introduction                 The Wallich is a homelessness charity delivering innovative housing and support services to homeless and vulnerably housed people. The Organisation formed in 1978 in Cardiff and now supports around 8000 people a year across Wales. Our work falls into four principal areas:            1. Residential supported housing projects, including direct access hostels, emergency night shelters and accommodation for people with specific issues such as substance misuse, youth services etc.            2. Floating (Tenancy) support projects in which we support people who have tenancy difficulties, sometimes with a contributing health or other need, and are in danger of losing their homes.            3. Prevention or intervention projects supplied through Homelessness Prevention Grant funding which are a broad range of services that prevent homelessness or make life better for homeless people.            4. Participation and Progression services, which are embedded in all our projects enhancing support through providing opportunities for Service Users to take an active part in their community. These services include those designed to enable people to move into meaningful activities including employment and training opportunities.            The Wallich’s values are of empowerment and treating people with dignity, respect and unconditional positive regard. The Wallich is committed to providing services that are trauma informed and delivered with Psychologically Informed Environments (PIE) at the heart of its support. A PIE is an approach to supporting people out of homelessness whilst making significant and positive progress in overcoming trauma, substance misuse and mental illness. It also considers the psychological needs of staff: developing skills and knowledge, increasing motivation, job satisfaction and resilience. At the heart of what we do are the people we support, who are actively and meaningfully involved in their own support and encouraged to participate in the design, development and delivery of services.

1249,"                  Introduction                 The Wallich is a homelessness charity delivering innovative housing and support services to homeless and vulnerably housed people. The Organisation formed in 1978 in Cardiff and now supports around 8000 people a year across Wales. Our work falls into four principal areas:            1. Residential supported housing projects, including direct access hostels, emergency night shelters and accommodation for people with specific issues such as substance misuse, youth services etc.            2. Floating (Tenancy) support projects in which we support people who have tenancy difficulties, sometimes with a contributing health or other need, and are in danger of losing their homes.            3. Prevention or intervention projects supplied through Homelessness Prevention Grant funding which are a broad range of services that prevent homelessness or make life better for homeless people.            4.

These services include those designed to enable people to move into meaningful activities including employment and training opportunities.

The accommodation provides 5 separate self contained units and 26 on suite bed rooms, with shared kitchen facilities on each floor. The scheme is staffed 24 hours, with Night Support Workers and Concierge cover during the evenings.                                                                                                                                                            The aim of the project is to assess the individual over an 8-12 week period with the aim of identifying their support and housing needs. In that period we will provide a bed for the customer to assist staff to carry out a detailed assessment to ensure that the recommendation for move on into supported housing is captured correctly. The onus is then on the council to move the individual onto more suitable longer term supported accommodation based on our assessment/recommendation.                                                                              The service operates a model of personalised approach in order to address a wide range of presenting complex needs, which could range from mild learning difficulties, substance use (alcohol and drugs), offending, mental health, dual diagnoses, etc. We work closely with outside agencies in order to ensure that the individual is linked into getting the correct support whilst they remain at the assessment centre.                                                                              A major part of the Assessment Support Workers role is putting in the foundation with our customers around basic living skills and preparing the individual to be ready to move into alternative supported accommodation.

1252,"                  Introduction                 The Wallich is a homelessness charity delivering innovative housing and support services to homeless and vulnerably housed people. The Organisation formed in 1978 in Cardiff and now supports around 8000 people a year across Wales. Our work falls into four principal areas:            1. Residential supported housing projects, including direct access hostels, emergency night shelters and accommodation for people with specific issues such as substance misuse, youth services etc.            2. Floating (Tenancy) support projects in which we support people who have tenancy difficulties, sometimes with a contributing health or other need, and are in danger of losing their homes.            3. Prevention or intervention projects supplied through Homelessness Prevention Grant funding which are a broad range of services that prevent homelessness or make life better for homeless people.            4. Participation and Progression services, which are embedded in all our projects enhancing support through providing opportunities for Service Users to take an active part in their community. These services include those designed to enable people to move into meaningful activities including employment and training opportunities.            The Wallich’s values are of empowerment and treating people with dignity, respect and unconditional positive regard. The Wallich is committed to providing services that are trauma informed and delivered with Psychologically Informed Environments (PIE) at the heart of its support. A PIE is an approach to supporting people out of homelessness whilst making significant and positive progress in overcoming trauma, substance misuse and mental illness. It also considers the psychological needs of staff: developing skills and knowledge, increasing motivation, job satisfaction and resilience. At the heart of what we do are the people we support, who are actively and meaningfully involved in their own support and encouraged to participate in the design, development and delivery of services.                  Project Description                 Working closely with the North Wales Collaborative Outreach Project, a multi-agency response team, the Collaborative Outreach Worker (Housing) will engage with vulnerable individuals with complex needs such as substance misuse, mental health, homelessness/housing and who are not engaging with support services generally.            Support provided by this post could include the provision of advice, support, information, help or onward referral in relation to housing or homelessness, welfare benefits, healthcare, debt, education, training or employment opportunities. In addition, assistance may also be required in meeting service users basic needs such as access to food, shelter, clothing, rough sleeper packs etc.            The project aims to wrap services around the individual by taking support out to them in their local community across Flintshire and Wrexham, working closely with other provider organisations to deliver support in their homes or in local hubs/drop in sites where service users can access a range of agencies in one place.            The North Wales Collaborative Outreach Project is led by three Coordinators, each covering two counties across North Wales – West, Central and East - who have cross-agency insight and will seek to draw all partners and their expertise together to deliver a joint holistic response to supporting people and to develop appropriate pathways to link people into mainstream services.            The project is funded by Welsh Government Complex Needs Funding and administered by the North Wales Area Planning Board                  Purpose of Role                 To coordinate and provide support that enables and empowers service users to address housing and/or personal difficulties, build their skills and confidence improving their ability to maintain their current or future accommodation.

1258,"                  Introduction                 The Wallich is a homelessness charity delivering innovative housing and support services to homeless and vulnerably housed people. The Organisation formed in 1978 in Cardiff and now supports around 8000 people a year across Wales. Our work falls into four principal areas:            1. Residential supported housing projects, including direct access hostels, emergency night shelters and accommodation for people with specific issues such as substance misuse, youth services etc.            2. Floating (Tenancy) support projects in which we support people who have tenancy difficulties, sometimes with a contributing health or other need, and are in danger of losing their homes.            3. Prevention or intervention projects supplied through Homelessness Prevention Grant funding which are a broad range of services that prevent homelessness or make life better for homeless people.            4. Participation and Progression services, which are embedded in all our projects enhancing support through providing opportunities for Service Users to take an active part in their community. These services include those designed to enable people to move into meaningful activities including employment and training opportunities.            The Wallich’s values are of empowerment and treating people with dignity, respect and unconditional positive regard. The Wallich is committed to providing services that are trauma informed and delivered with Psychologically Informed Environments (PIE) at the heart of its support. A PIE is an approach to supporting people out of homelessness whilst making significant and positive progress in overcoming trauma, substance misuse and mental illness. It also considers the psychological needs of staff: developing skills and knowledge, increasing motivation, job satisfaction and resilience. At the heart of what we do are the people we support, who are actively and meaningfully involved in their own support and encouraged to participate in the design, development and delivery of services.                  Project Description                 The project is located in Bridgend and works with homeless and potentially homeless people. The service provides residential support with the aim of meeting individuals’ needs, which promote independence and lead to a sustainable move-on. The project is funded through the Supporting People Programme Grant and is required to meet the Welsh Government’s National Outcomes Framework. The Framework’s four main aims are:                  Promoting Personal and Community Safety                       Promoting Independence and Control                       Promoting Economic Progress and Financial Control                       Promoting Health and Wellbeing                       Purpose of Role                 To provide residential support that enables and empowers Service Users to address housing and/or personal difficulties, build their skills and confidence, and ultimately improve their ability to maintain their future accommodation. The support will not create or increase dependence. It will ‘do with’ rather than ‘do for’, so it’s likely that support will involve accompanying Service Users initially, in order to familiarise them with an activity or appointment. Support will help people improve their control, understanding and involvement in dealing with the issues that affect them, and assist Service Users to achieve their preferred outcomes.

1260,"                  Introduction                 The Wallich is a homelessness charity delivering innovative housing and support services to homeless and vulnerably housed people. The Organisation formed in 1978 in Cardiff and now supports around 8000 people a year across Wales. Our work falls into four principal areas:            1. Residential supported housing projects, including direct access hostels, emergency night shelters and accommodation for people with specific issues such as substance misuse, youth services etc.            2. Floating (Tenancy) support projects in which we support people who have tenancy difficulties, sometimes with a contributing health or other need, and are in danger of losing their homes.            3. Prevention or intervention projects supplied through Homelessness Prevention Grant funding which are a broad range of services that prevent homelessness or make life better for homeless people.            4. Participation and Progression services, which are embedded in all our projects enhancing support through providing opportunities for Service Users to take an active part in their community. These services include those designed to enable people to move into meaningful activities including employment and training opportunities.            The Wallich’s values are of empowerment and treating people with dignity, respect and unconditional positive regard. The Wallich is committed to providing services that are trauma informed and delivered with Psychologically Informed Environments (PIE) at the heart of its support. A PIE is an approach to supporting people out of homelessness whilst making significant and positive progress in overcoming trauma, substance misuse and mental illness. It also considers the psychological needs of staff: developing skills and knowledge, increasing motivation, job satisfaction and resilience. At the heart of what we do are the people we support, who are actively and meaningfully involved in their own support and encouraged to participate in the design, development and delivery of services.                  Project Description                 The project operates across Swansea and works with priority needs homeless people to provide housing related support within temporary accommodation as a safe alternative to Bed and Breakfast accommodation. The service provides residential support with the aim of meeting individuals’ needs, which promote independence and lead to a sustainable move-on. The project is funded through the Supporting People Programme Grant and is required to meet the Welsh Government’s National Outcomes Framework. The Framework’s four main aims are:                           Promoting Personal and Community Safety                  Promoting Independence and Control                  Promoting Economic Progress and Financial Control                  Promoting Health and Wellbeing                                 Purpose of Role                 To provide support to Service Users who are living in independent temporary accommodation across Swansea, that enables and empowers Service Users to address housing and/or personal difficulties, build their skills and confidence, and ultimately improve their ability to maintain their future accommodation. The support will not create or increase dependence. It will ‘do with’ rather than ‘do for’, so it’s likely that support will involve accompanying Service Users initially, in order to familiarise them with an activity or appointment. Support will help people improve their control, understanding and involvement in dealing with the issues that affect them, and assist Service Users to achieve their preferred outcomes. In addition, to assist with the housing management needs of the project ensuring the delivery of a safe, secure and effective service.

The Organisation formed in 1978 in Cardiff and now supports around 8000 people a year across Wales. Our work falls into four principal areas:            1. Residential supported housing projects, including direct access hostels, emergency night shelters and accommodation for people with specific issues such as substance misuse, youth services etc.            2. Floating (Tenancy) support projects in which we support people who have tenancy difficulties, sometimes with a contributing health or other need, and are in danger of losing their homes.            3. Prevention or intervention projects supplied through Homelessness Prevention Grant funding which are a broad range of services that prevent homelessness or make life better for homeless people.            4. Participation and Progression services, which are embedded in all our projects enhancing support through providing opportunities for Service Users to take an active part in their community. These services include those designed to enable people to move into meaningful activities including employment and training opportunities.            The Wallich’s values are of empowerment and treating people with dignity, respect and unconditional positive regard. The Wallich is committed to providing services that are trauma informed and delivered with Psychologically Informed Environments (PIE) at the heart of its support. A PIE is an approach to supporting people out of homelessness whilst making significant and positive progress in overcoming trauma, substance misuse and mental illness. It also considers the psychological needs of staff: developing skills and knowledge, increasing motivation, job satisfaction and resilience. At the heart of what we do are the people we support, who are actively and meaningfully involved in their own support and encouraged to participate in the design, development and delivery of services.

The service will be delivered across 7 days per week between the hours of 8am – 7pm Monday – Friday and between the hours of 10am – 4pm on Saturday – Sunday with the length and type of sessions based on need.

1267,"                  Introduction                 The Wallich is a homelessness charity delivering innovative housing and support services to homeless and vulnerably housed people. The Organisation formed in 1978 in Cardiff and now supports around 8000 people a year across Wales. Our work falls into four principal areas:            1. Residential supported housing projects, including direct access hostels, emergency night shelters and accommodation for people with specific issues such as substance misuse, youth services etc.            2. Floating (Tenancy) support projects in which we support people who have tenancy difficulties, sometimes with a contributing health or other need, and are in danger of losing their homes.            3. Prevention or intervention projects supplied through Homelessness Prevention Grant funding which are a broad range of services that prevent homelessness or make life better for homeless people.            4. Participation and Progression services, which are embedded in all our projects enhancing support through providing opportunities for Service Users to take an active part in their community. These services include those designed to enable people to move into meaningful activities including employment and training opportunities.            The Wallich’s values are of empowerment and treating people with dignity, respect and unconditional positive regard. The Wallich is committed to providing services that are trauma informed and delivered with Psychologically Informed Environments (PIE) at the heart of its support. A PIE is an approach to supporting people out of homelessness whilst making significant and positive progress in overcoming trauma, substance misuse and mental illness. It also considers the psychological needs of staff: developing skills and knowledge, increasing motivation, job satisfaction and resilience. At the heart of what we do are the people we support, who are actively and meaningfully involved in their own support and encouraged to participate in the design, development and delivery of services.                  Project Description                 The project operates across Wrexham working with Service Users who will be stable and/or in treatment or recently released from prison and engaged in relapse prevention work with the Substance Misuse Service. The service provides residential and floating support with the aim of meeting individuals’ needs, which promote independence and lead to a sustainable move-on. The project also provides housing related support within people’s homes or in the community, with the aim of preventing homelessness and increasing independence. The project is funded through the Housing Support Grant and is required to meet the Welsh Government’s National Outcomes Framework. The Framework’s four main aims are:                  Promoting Personal and Community Safety                       Promoting Independence and Control                       Promoting Economic Progress and Financial Control                       Promoting Health and Wellbeing                       Purpose of Role                 To coordinate and provide floating support that enables and empowers Service Users to address housing and/or personal difficulties, build their skills and confidence, and ultimately improve their ability to maintain their current or future accommodation.

1271,"                  Introduction                 The Wallich is a homelessness charity delivering innovative housing and support services to homeless and vulnerably housed people. The Organisation formed in 1978 in Cardiff and now supports around 8000 people a year across Wales. Our work falls into four principal areas:            1. Residential supported housing projects, including direct access hostels, emergency night shelters and accommodation for people with specific issues such as substance misuse, youth services etc.            2. Floating (Tenancy) support projects in which we support people who have tenancy difficulties, sometimes with a contributing health or other need, and are in danger of losing their homes.            3. Prevention or intervention projects supplied through Homelessness Prevention Grant funding which are a broad range of services that prevent homelessness or make life better for homeless people.            4. Participation and Progression services, which are embedded in all our projects enhancing support through providing opportunities for Service Users to take an active part in their community. These services include those designed to enable people to move into meaningful activities including employment and training opportunities.            The Wallich’s values are of empowerment and treating people with dignity, respect and unconditional positive regard. The Wallich is committed to providing services that are trauma informed and delivered with Psychologically Informed Environments (PIE) at the heart of its support. A PIE is an approach to supporting people out of homelessness whilst making significant and positive progress in overcoming trauma, substance misuse and mental illness. It also considers the psychological needs of staff: developing skills and knowledge, increasing motivation, job satisfaction and resilience. At the heart of what we do are the people we support, who are actively and meaningfully involved in their own support and encouraged to participate in the design, development and delivery of services.                  Project Description                 The EAST DAWS project is a drug and alcohol service delivered across the counties of Flintshire and Wrexham to adult drug and/or alcohol users, their families and carers.
